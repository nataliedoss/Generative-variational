Generative variational inference in C
---------------------------

This is a C-implementation of the mean-field variational algorithm for the
logistic normal latent embedding model for correlated categorical data.

It was built from the 2007 ctm-c code of David Blei and John Lafferty.
See https://github.com/blei-lab/ctm-c for the original.

This code requires the GSL library.

A. COMPILING

Type "make" in a shell.  Note: the Makefile currently points to the
GSL version on my machine.  You will probably want to
point to the BLAS library on your machine. The file Makefile_old should help with this.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

B. Data format

The data is a file where each line is of the form:

     [u] covariate-1 covariate-2 covariate-3 

* [u] is the data point number (but actually you can have any integer 0-9 here).

* covariate-i is the one-hot encoding of the covariate, i.e., it is a K-length vector with one slot equal to one and the rest equal to zero.

C. Estimating a model

The command to estimate a model is:

./ctm est <dataset> <# covariates> <# categories> <latent dimension> <fixed/rand> <dir> <settings>

For example:

./ctm est dat_bin_100_2_1_m_.txt 100 3 2 fixed results settings.txt 

- <dataset> is the file described above in part B.

- <# covariates> is the number of covariates. It is the same for each data point.

- <# categories> is the number of categories per each covariate. IT IS ASSUMED TO BE THE SAME FOR ALL COVARIATES.

- <latent dim> is the latent dimension. It is decided by the user.

- <fixed/rand> indicates how to initialize EM: with fixed values of beta or some chosen at random. 

- <dir> is the directory in which to place the files associated with
  this run of variational EM.  (See part D below.)

- <settings> is a settings file.  For example, the inf-settings.txt file
  is good for EM and looks like this: 

                  em max iter 1000
                  var max iter 20
                  cg max iter -1
                  em convergence 1e-3
                  var convergence 1e-6
                  cg convergence 1e-6
                  lag 10
                  covariance estimate mle

  The first item ("em max iter") is the maximum number of EM
  iterations.

  The second item ("var max iter") is the maximum number of variational iterations,
  i.e., passes through each variational parameter (-1 indicates to
  iterate until the convergence criterion is met.)

  The third item ("cg max iter") is the maximum number of conjugate
  gradient iterations in fitting the variational mean and variance per
  document.

  Items 4-6 are convergence criterions for EM, variational inference,
  and conjugate gradient, respectively.

  The 7th item ("lag") is the multiple of iterations of EM after which
  to save a version of the model.  This is useful, for example, if you
  want to monitor how the model changes from iteration to iteration.

  The 8th item ("covariance estimate") is what technique to estimate
  the covariance with.  The choices are "mle" or "shrinkage."

D. MODEL EXAMINATION

1. Once EM has converged, the model directory will be populated with
several files that can be used to examine the resulting model fit, for
example to make topic graph figures or compute similarity between
documents.

All the files are stored in row major format.  They can be read into R
with the command:

     x <- matrix(scan(FILENAME), byrow=T, nrow=NR, ncol=NC),

where FILENAME is the file, NR is the number of rows, and NC is the
number of columns. The files are as follows:

    final-cov.dat, final-inv-cov.dat, final-log-det-inv-cov: These are
    files corresponding to the d x d covariance matrix where d is the latent
    dimension.

    final-mu.dat: This is the d-dimensional mean vector of the logistic normal
    over topic proportions.

    final-lambda.dat and final-nu.dat: This is a U x d matrix of the
    variational mean parameter for each document.

    final-nu: This is the U x d matrix of the variational variance
    parameter for each document in the collection.

    likelihood.dat: This is a record of the likelihood bound at each
    iteration of EM.  The columns are: old likelihood bound, new likelihood bound, 
    convergence criterion, time in seconds of the iteration, average number of
    variational iterations per document, the percentage of documents
    that reached the variational convergence criterion.
